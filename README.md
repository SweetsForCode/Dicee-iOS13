# Dicee
Dicee was provided by the world's best online programming courses, The App Brewery !(https://appbrewery.com/?_ga=2.135849209.932060850.1708224738-1319108131.1707594403)

## My Goal

My Goal of this tutorial is to refresh my memory on Swift 5.0 and the fundamental basics of Swift programming. 

## What I created

Through this course I created a _Las Vegas Dice App_. I was able to create randomization through Swift's built in .randomElement() function. I was also able to get a refresher on Arrays, UIImages, Views, Buttons, UIOutlets & UIActions. 

## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Learn to use comments to annotate code. (I was also able to remember using the //MARK:- comment 
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
